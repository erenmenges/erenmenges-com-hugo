I am Eren Mengeş, a 19-year-old NYU student. I major in Computer Science and am really passionate in it. Especially AI, cybersecurity and software engineering. I hate front-dev. There is nothing that upsets me more than HTML, CSS, and JS. I love Python though. I also very much enjoy DSA and Leetcode.

I am also a member of the ZBT fraternity. I think I'd die from boredom at an engineering school if I wasn't.
&nbsp;

Oh also my whole life purpose is to invent AGI and cause the intelligence explosion. Think of the Maslov scale for needs. The top of my pyramid is inventing AGI.

I also want to get into Quantum Computing but I haven't found the time.

Feel free to reach out!
